# nacaairfoil
NACA Airfoil plugin for Blender.

Based on [NACA_Airfoil_2.py by David Wehr](https://blenderartists.org/t/naca-airfoil-generator/519965/6).

## Usage

This plugin is developed for and tested on Blender 2.81.

### Installation

Download or clone this repository, then in Blender go to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> Install... â”€ and choose NACA_Airfoil.py. Click the check box beside the plugin to activate it.

### Creating an airfoil

In Object mode on a 3D Viewport, click Add -> Mesh -> NACA Airfoil. This will insert an airfoil at the origin.

A properties panel will be visible in the bottom left corner until the object is deselected. Through it the parameters of the airfoil can be modified.

## Limitations

 * Currently this plugin can only make standard 4 digit NACA Airfoils.
